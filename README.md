YT-No-Cookie Viewer is a minimalist web interface designed to help you watch YouTube videos with fewer distractions. By removing recommendations, comments, and sidebars, it provides a less engaging way to enjoy content and helps combat YouTube addiction.

## How to Use

1. **Block Direct Access to YouTube (Optional but Recommended):**

   To prevent accidental visits to YouTube's main site, you can block it by editing your `/etc/hosts` file:

   ```bash
   127.0.0.1 youtube.com www.youtube.com
   ```

   *This step ensures you won't be tempted by YouTube's homepage or recommended videos.*

2. **Use YT-No-Cookie Viewer:**

   - **Open** the YT-No-Cookie Viewer web page in your browser.
   - **Paste** the YouTube video URL into the input bar provided.
   - **Enjoy** the video embedded on the page without any recommendations or distractions.

   *The viewer uses YouTube's no-cookie embed feature, enhancing your privacy by not storing tracking cookies.*
